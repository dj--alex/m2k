It's remake my old 8bit zx-spectrum game "Mission 2000 by rasoft" (Ras0ft) from 1998.  In game you must destroy targets - mines and trolls to go to next level.

100> objects, 100> levels + level editor.  All Maps except 1 are exported from original ZX spectrum! (game can read Hobeta format)

Support 2 players on one keyboard if you take tank two times.

Player 1 - keys cursor,
Player 2 - keys numpad
